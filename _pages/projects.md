## 1. [ML-EECBS - Learning a better cost-to-go heuristic for EECBS](/projects/project-1/)

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
**Introduction:**  
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is crucial for applications like warehouse automation, traffic management, and gaming. Efficient solutions require collision-free paths for agents while optimizing costs. Enhanced ECBS (EECBS) incorporates online learning to improve heuristic accuracy, yet its handcrafted heuristic struggles with precision. This project proposes a machine learning framework for estimating the cost-to-go heuristic, improving runtime and search efficiency.

**Social Impact:**  
By reducing computational time and improving scalability, ML-EECBS enables faster, more cost-effective operations, contributing to increased productivity, energy efficiency, and seamless integration of autonomous systems into society.

## 2. [Optimal control strategies for a two-link trapeze-jumping Acrobot](/projects/project-2/)

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
**Introduction:**  
Trapeze-jumping acrobots present unique challenges in robotics due to their under-actuated and nonlinear nature. This project aimed to develop an optimal control strategy that allows an acrobot to transition seamlessly between trapeze bars. The study focused on minimizing energy consumption while maintaining trajectory precision and stability.

**Social Impact:**  
The trapeze-jumping acrobot project was a toy project, but it has the potential to advance robotics in dynamic and high-precision tasks, contributing to safer and more efficient automation in hazardous environments like construction, maintenance, or rescue operations.

## 3. [Development of an Automatic Recovery Algorithm for ASML's In-Vacuum Robot](/projects/project-3/)

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
**Introduction:**  
In ASML's lithography machines, the In-Vacuum Robot (IVR) plays a critical role in transferring reticles between radially aligned stations. During operations, deviations from predefined logical positions can occur due to driver failures, power outages, or mechanical malfunctions. Recovery from such lost positions is typically manual, resulting in significant downtime and risks of collision. This project aimed to develop an automated recovery algorithm to reduce recovery time, enhance operational efficiency, and mitigate human error.

**Social Impact:**  
The ASML project significantly reduced robot recovery times in lithography machines, enhancing operational efficiency and minimizing downtime.
