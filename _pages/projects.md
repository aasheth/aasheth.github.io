## 1. [ML-EECBS - Learning a better cost-to-go heuristic for EECBS](/projects/project-1/)

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
**Introduction:**  
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is crucial for applications like warehouse automation, traffic management, and gaming. Efficient solutions require collision-free paths for agents while optimizing costs. Enhanced ECBS (EECBS) incorporates online learning to improve heuristic accuracy, yet its handcrafted heuristic struggles with precision. This project proposes a machine learning framework for estimating the cost-to-go heuristic, improving runtime and search efficiency.

**Social Impact:**  
This work enhances infrastructure safety, promotes environmental sustainability, and supports healthcare innovation by enabling simulations for real-world geometries.

**GitHub Link:** Coming soon (will be added post-research publication).

## 3. [Development of an Automatic Recovery Algorithm for ASML's In-Vacuum Robot](/projects/project-3/)

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
**Introduction:**  
In ASML's lithography machines, the In-Vacuum Robot (IVR) plays a critical role in transferring reticles between radially aligned stations. During operations, deviations from predefined logical positions can occur due to driver failures, power outages, or mechanical malfunctions. Recovery from such lost positions is typically manual, resulting in significant downtime and risks of collision. This project aimed to develop an automated recovery algorithm to reduce recovery time, enhance operational efficiency, and mitigate human error.

**Social Impact:**  
This project democratizes access to scientific insights, empowering researchers, students, and educators to analyze and understand complex visualizations effortlessly.
