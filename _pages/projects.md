## 1. [Open-Source GeoFNO Implementation for Irregular Geometries in PDE Solvers](/projects/project-1/)

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
**Introduction:**  
Partial differential equations (PDEs) are essential for simulating physical phenomena across fields such as engineering and healthcare. This project focuses on overcoming the limitations of traditional PDE solvers in handling irregular geometries. By implementing Geo-FNO within the Unified PDE Solver (UPS) framework, we aim to provide accessible and scalable simulation capabilities.

**Social Impact:**  
This work enhances infrastructure safety, promotes environmental sustainability, and supports healthcare innovation by enabling simulations for real-world geometries.

**GitHub Link:** Coming soon (will be added post-research publication).
