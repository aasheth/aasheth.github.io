### **Professional Experience**  
**Mechatronics/Robotics Controls Intern**, ASML, Connecticut  
Path Planning & Decision-Making Algorithm for In-Vacuum Robot (IVR) and Pod-Handler
-	Developed a recovery algorithm for an in-vacuum robot, utilizing motor and sensor data for real-time decision-making to locate the nearest recovery station and plan collision-free paths. Implemented the algorithm using OOP in MATLAB.
-	Created a custom Simulink model to simulate and visualize the robot's trajectory and validate test vectors
-	Built an interactive GUI that integrates algorithm & Simulink model, serving as an efficient development tool for debugging and testing
-	Reduced recovery time from over 1 hour to <1 minute, significantly reducing lithography machine downtime by several hours


**Energy Analyst**, ICF Consulting  
- Contributed to energy models showing pathways to reduce India’s import bill by **$20B**.  
- Specialized in hydrogen adoption studies, receiving the prestigious ‘Bronze Award.’
